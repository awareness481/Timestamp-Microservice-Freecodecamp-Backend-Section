#### User stories

[x] 
Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Glitch.
[x] I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).
[x] If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
[x] If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
